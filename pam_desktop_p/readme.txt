Desktop Printers by Pat and Mikael (PAM)

Q: How do I install it?
A: Just drag the folder "pam_desktop_p" into "garrysmod/addons" and it will work. Remember to do a FastDL sync after a restart.

Q: How do I configure it?
A: You go into "garrysmod/addons/pam_desktop_p/lua/entities/pat_desktop_printer/shared.lua" and edit what you need. DON'T TOUCH pat_desktop_base

Q: But there's only 1 printer!
A: By default there's only 1, but adding another one is super easy. Just copy pat_desktop_printer and rename it, baam you've got yourself a new printer. Remember to configure it different from your others ofc :)
 
Q: Why are the printers purple & black?
A: Do a FastDL sync.

Q: How do I edit upgrades?
A: Go into "garrysmod/addons/pam_desktop_p/lua/entities/*upgrade you wish to edit "/init.lua" and change what you want to change.

Q: How do I make new upgrades?
A: Just copy one of the existing, rename it (needs to have the prefix pat_desktop_upgrades_*upgradetype*_) and configure it as you want.

Q: Donator stuff?
A: In an update. I'll make a modifier, like setting it to 150 and donators get 150% money/points/experience when withdrawing
